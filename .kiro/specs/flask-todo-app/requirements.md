# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple todo application using Python Flask. The application will allow users to manage their daily tasks through a web interface, providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for todo items. The application will be lightweight, easy to use, and suitable for personal task management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my todo items in a list, so that I can see what tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the main page THEN the system SHALL display all existing todo items in a list format
2. WHEN there are no todo items THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the list is empty
3. WHEN displaying todo items THEN the system SHALL show the task description and completion status for each item

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new todo items, so that I can track new tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the add todo form THEN the system SHALL provide an input field for the task description
2. WHEN the user submits a new todo item with valid text THEN the system SHALL save the item and redirect to the main list
3. WHEN the user submits an empty todo item THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not save the item
4. WHEN a new todo item is created THEN the system SHALL set its status to incomplete by default

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark todo items as complete or incomplete, so that I can track my progress on tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a todo item's status toggle THEN the system SHALL update the completion status
2. WHEN a todo item is marked as complete THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it from incomplete items
3. WHEN the status is updated THEN the system SHALL persist the change and refresh the display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete todo items, so that I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the delete button for a todo item THEN the system SHALL remove the item from the list
2. WHEN a todo item is deleted THEN the system SHALL update the display to reflect the removal
3. WHEN the user attempts to delete a non-existent item THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean and simple web interface, so that I can easily navigate and use the todo functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive web interface
2. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL use clear navigation and intuitive controls
3. WHEN the user interacts with forms THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and validation messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to run in a Docker container environment, so that I can easily deploy and run the application consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL include a Dockerfile that containerizes the Flask application
2. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN the system SHALL provide a docker-compose.yaml file for easy orchestration
3. WHEN running in a container THEN the system SHALL expose the Flask application on a configurable port
4. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL automatically initialize any required dependencies and start the Flask server
